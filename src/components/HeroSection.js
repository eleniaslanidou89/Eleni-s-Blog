        During my internship I had the chance to exercise the knowledge I gained on Web development the last years. My focus and attention to detail combined with my knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and React are my strong points. More specifically I worked with REST APIs, React and Next.js.

        My problem-solving mindset, and my excellent communication skills would make me a good fit in any team. As a great team player, I would love to be part of a team, where I can learn and contribute.
